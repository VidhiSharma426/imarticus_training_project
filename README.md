# Heart Disease Prediction

![Heart Disease]
## Overview

This project is aimed at predicting the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various health metrics and clinical parameters. Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in its management and prevention.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [[Heart Disease dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aasheesh200/framingham-heart-study-dataset)] from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains various attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and ECG results, along with a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset was cleaned, missing values were handled, and categorical variables were encoded as necessary.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploratory data analysis was performed to gain insights into the distribution of variables, correlations, and potential patterns in the data.

3. **Feature Engineering**: New features were created, and existing features were transformed to improve model performance.

4. **Model Selection**: Several machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting were trained and evaluated.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Models were evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC to assess their predictive capabilities.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Hyperparameters of the best-performing models were fine-tuned using techniques such as grid search or random search to optimize performance further.

## Results

The trained models achieved promising results in predicting heart disease, with accuracy scores ranging from [insert range] and other performance metrics indicating [insert performance details].

## Usage

1. **Installation**: Clone the repository and install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your dataset in a compatible format (e.g., CSV) and ensure it contains similar features as the Heart Disease UCI dataset.

3. **Model Training**: Train the predictive models using the provided scripts or Jupyter notebooks.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained models using the test dataset or cross-validation techniques.

5. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model as a standalone application or integrate it into existing systems for real-time predictions.

## Future Work

- Incorporate additional data sources or features to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Explore advanced machine learning techniques such as deep learning for improved performance.
- Develop a user-friendly web application for easy access and usage by healthcare professionals and individuals.
